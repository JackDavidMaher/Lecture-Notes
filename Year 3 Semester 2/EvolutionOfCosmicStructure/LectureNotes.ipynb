    "## 3 problems of the universe:\n",
    "1. The flatness problem\n",
    "    - Why is the universe so close to being spatially flat?\n",
    "    - if omega (Ω) deviates slightly from 1 in the early universe, it would have diverged significantly over time, leading to a highly curved universe today. Yet, observations show that Ω is very close to 1.\n",
    "2. The horizon problem\n",
    "    - Why is the cosmic microwave background (CMB) so uniform in temperature across the sky, despite regions being out of causal contact?\n",
    "3. The monopole problem\n",
    "    - Why don't we observe magnetic monopoles, which are predicted by certain grand unified theories?\n",
    "## Inflation Theory\n",
    "d^2a/dt^2 / a = - (4πG/3) (ρ + 3pw)\n",
    "if w < -1/3, then d^2a/dt^2 > 0 (accelerated expansion)\n",
    "- Inflation proposes a period of rapid exponential expansion in the early universe, driven by a high-energy vacuum state (false vacuum) with negative pressure (w < -1/3).\n",
    "- This rapid expansion can solve the flatness problem by driving Ω towards 1, the horizon problem by allowing regions to come into causal contact before inflation, and the monopole problem by diluting the density of monopoles to negligible levels.\n"
